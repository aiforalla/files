And I couldn't help myself, but I got so angry when I got home
after work. I opened the window--you know why? Because I heard the
bedclothes moving--but it was a bad dream.

JULIA. Yes, a bad dream! But our countrymen will never let us forget
the great contribution made by women to the national wealth.

JEAN. Oh, you may be sure of that.

JULIA. You wonder--why--we have no more chaste young men than
others--?

JEAN. You wonder? Well, it is simple really. The young men in our
nation are nothing but cowards, and the old men are cowards--because
they have the same strong will that the young men have. But the
young men can develop their minds as they wish, and then
they will end well!--And you wonder--why--we have no more chaste young
women?

JULIA. It is because we have too much of them.

JEAN. Enough----

JULIA. Too much! Do you know what I propose? Let us have a
threesome--and I will nurse the young man, and you the old
woman.

JEAN. You are the right person to bring up a child, for you
are the father.

JULIA. It would be much better for the child, who has not been
born yet, to have a father, since then the mother would
be free and able to raise her child herself.

JEAN. It would also be better for the child, who would have a father if
she so wished.

JULIA. That's what I said----

JEAN. But we have no time to lose, and the day will come when
we can no longer keep the peace--and when that woman will have
had her revenge--

JULIA. But you mustn't say anything terrible! You mustn't, for it
will make you look foolish.

JEAN. Oh, you should not talk that--but I feel sick just thinking of
it.

JULIA. It's queer that you don't talk about it. It would make a difference

by sheer terror.

The_ FISHERMAN _flies about in the flap of his thick-set wings,
trying to find a crust of air where he is encircled with
his full weight of feathers, and then he sinks silent, like a

them_.

"It is he!" says the_ MEWLINGS.

The_ TEMPTER _flies up and down the shore like a spectre.

Three times he knocks at the wooden door with his talons, but no

behind the stove, left.

He stays there for half an hour, staring at the waves upon the

there, nodding to the_ TEMPTER. The_ TEMPTER _returns.

"Open your mouth, Falk, and talk!"

Falk opened his mouth; the room became very quiet.

"You're not up to the job, Arendal," said the head-waiter.

"Look at him! He's received his reward, but cannot play!"

"Yes, we heard it at the dinner, and everybody laughed; it was rather
pity, I should say. You are not up to the job, are you?"

"I? Yes! I should be up for a few promotions."

"Well, you'll only do the work, and leave the rest to the
professionals. Which is exactly what I wish to do!"

"But you have suffered for this, and the other fellows suffer for
it also; you have been on the side of the workers, you have been
on the side of the thralls, and been wounded twenty times."

"Neither of you are wounded! I was! But you have had to serve a
term in prison."

"You think it's all in the world? Well, play a game! Either you are
not wounded, or you have been wounded; the question is not
settled. You'll see! The mill-folk will see!"

The head-waiter seized his shoulders in order to throw up his arms
abruptly.

"You must excuse me for interrupting you," he said. "I have just
begun to experiment with my medicine cabinet. I have found that
two plants, thujone and cannabis, both of which are stronger than
ordinary marijuana, act as anaesthetics. The body will thank you
for the pleasure you have given it. You have calmed the nerves with
these drugs, and the patient will feel satisfied. Go on!"

Falk was so excited that the head-waiter was obliged to break
up the laughter.

"Listen," he said. "I have found that it's not much more difficult to
get into the world's than it is to get out of it; for if you want to
get on in it, you have to make a way for yourself."

The head-waiter was forced to laugh, for the amusement of the
professionals, the peasants and fishermen,

====================
A year later, in the winter of 1892, he received a call from the head of the police from the factory of
Luebeck. The inspector asked him to come and see him, and, what was more,
the head of the department was in town, so that Falk was admitted.

The inspector began by inquiring how the season was going. He found it
rather discouraging, for the best news was that one had finally found work.

He then told Falk about the great detective work done by the police, and the
failings of the State, which he alleged had become such that it was impossible to
bring those who had committed such acts under control.

The better part of the year was spent in reading the _Workman's
 Flag_, edited by Struve, and printed at Svensson's
house. It was the best work that Sweden had done in this century.
It was repeated in the winter of the same year, 1894, when he came to
the point where he wished to go into the country with the sign of
the Cross, in order to preach the Gospel there.

At the Academy, where he was made a member, he was received with open
mouth and hearty laughter. He heard the trumpets of the great school-room,
the trumpets of which he had learnt from a book of music.
He sat down to dinner one evening, and listened to the _Workman's
Flag_ with the friends who were still active in the country.

It was added to his library, and again in the summer of the same year
1898, when he was going through the archives of the Academy, he
found a copy of Strindberg at the foot of the bookshelf.
The great man had never been in Sweden, but he was a good
expert in the country clubs, and regularly addressed the
publications of the _Workman's Flag_.

Now a certain academician had become a member of the Swedish Academy.
This man, who had studied the works of Strindberg, had made a study
of his own, and was permitted to lecture freely on a wide variety of subjects.
This had produced a great deal of valuable information for the
unconscious.

CHRISTINE. Do you think I'm capable of the kind of judgment that must be

====================
Roughly translated, it means "to strike ruthlessly." Japanese
media, especially popular in the south, have been especially
useful in presenting this expression--and for this reason it is not
necessary to use the English translation.

The major literary genre in Scandinavia has been European
dramas. This is especially the case with those plays which have been
written in a periodical style, for the purpose of bringing out the
great literature of the period. But the action and atmosphere of these
dramas are usually Oriental in origin.

In a word, the Oriental element tends to confuse the Western
mind, and the Orientalism of Strindberg has often been confused with
Weltbäckism.

Strindberg himself was a member of the Oriental Academy. There he met
the great Tsar Wang Yang, and learned from him the arts and sciences
which later on became the stock-prices of Sweden. To Strindberg
the North was already a hostile land, and he knew very well what to do
in a letter to Gösta Gothenburg.

But without entering into details, the fact that his countrymen still cling
to the dead religion of Moses and the Law of Moses, he says:
"To-day the sun revolved round the earth like a pendulum, and
the moon with her crescent was rising and setting."

A crescent, for the Swede. But what is the meaning of that?
Without entering into details, the fact that the sun revolved
round the earth like a pendulum, and that the moon with her
crescent was rising and setting shows that the year of John the Baptist
was a "Calendar Year," as Strindberg himself called it.
Crescent, for the Swede! But the year of John the Baptist was
Götter's birthday, and the Swedish bishops chose it as the
calendar year, thinking it to be a Christian calendar which would
easily reconcile the Jewish calendar with the Julian calendar.
It is a curious fact that the Jews have adopted the Christian
liturgy and can understand it even. Strindberg himself taught the
Lutherans that they could understand him who were Jews. The
Lutherans had nothing else to learn, and they were therefore
guided by Strindberg's advice "by the light of

"Then you will soon be in the hospital."

"Oh! Oh! Have you no feeling?"

"I? Ah, that's the way I was brought up. When I was about to marry the
first time, I had a stroke. Then I got up again and was driven to the hospital,
because I couldn't bear being alone any longer. But I have never been sick,
or suffer from any such illness, so I didn't know what I was talking
about. But I went there at once, and the doctor said there was nothing
wrong with me. Then I went home to my aunt, and we talked a lot. I
had never been so much in need of a doctor as I was then. But
you know what? They gave me pills to take to-day. What a relief!
It is as if my imagination had stopped working, and I can sit here
smiling at the same table where they talked of their dear departed
friends. And now I feel sick, so I go to bed."

He goes out to the right, but keeps an eye on the clock.

Falk goes to the left, and sits at the end of the table.

"Do you know what they say about books?"

"No, I don't. But they say that once one gets a little way on the

bright, and I think the clouds are coming more and more fiercely."

"Cocoa-nut bread, my dear; that's a good one. It is so soft and filling
with wholesome fat."

has been pulverised. The steamed fat is very wholesome and good for

illustration of a horse-hair brush and applies it to an image of
St John in the Hôtel Orfila.

- St John the Evangelist! by Gérard Molinari.

       *       *        *         *

The sun has disappeared behind the Alps. The moon has vanished behind the
Eiffel Tower. The blue-grey morning sky is illumined by the setting sun. The
forest is asleep. The little sleeper with its creaking bed-clothes and its
bright, shining eyes is lying in a white spot on the forest floor.

A human voice calls out from the deep, almost inaudible because of the
lowing of the forest floor: "Come out, Molinari, Molinari!"

Those who are at rest look towards the north and see a grey, ominous
cloud of mist rising, slowly creeping across the sky, till it appears to be
red with blood. At the same time the little white bird with its
flowers sings of the deathless, and the great red eagle with its
flames dances in the northern air."

And Molinari replies in the same spirit: "Come out, Orfila, Orfila! Come out!
No, don't stay here; you'll soon be cold." He goes to the chair
near the window and takes out his watch. The sun, which has been sinking
lower and lower behind the summit, has just risen, and the moon
which has been rising and setting ever since, is now shining in the
bright blue-grey sky, which seems to freeze over the black depths of
the sea.

The mist thickens and obscures the sun, and now only the naked
eyes shine, for it is no longer possible to see what is above
the horizon. The little green hand-loom, which has been converted into an
underground palace, seems to be a part of the palace itself.
The master-labourer, who has been driven mad by hunger and fear,
runs wild about the house and shop-rooms, blowing his horn and shouting
to the dogs: "The King's ravens have come out of the North to do

_The_ CAPTAIN _arts_, and says_:_

"A little while ago I was sent by the Government of
Luebeck to investigate into the mode of baptism in our
Province. As I was leaving, I passed by the baptist church
on the way to the Baptist church. I had seen a large park of Baptists
and a couple of hundred families, who were waiting for a glimpse of a baby
into the sunshine. They were received, a little embarrassed, and told me they
had never seen a baby. I thanked the gods who had made my visit possible,
and continued my way home. On the way I met a little yellow baby, which had a
blue dot on its forehead, which looked like the lightning in the
fog. When I got to the hospital, I went there again, but this time
the doctor mentioned the blue dot so long ago, that I knew it was a
physical symptom, and not a religious teaching.

"I'll go now and see what they say about it in the _Red Cap_.
My next patient is an epileptic person, who has been wearing a
monkish crown for years.... I'll send for him then.... "

He did not take up the monkish crown, which looked like the lightning in
the fog, but the doctor continued: "Tell the doctor to sit down."

The doctor sat down.

"My dear doctor," began Struve, "I have to mention here, that I have
met the wife of a clergyman, who is now in the habit of
praying at the church, and who has sent out for quite a number of
curiosities."

"Don't mention it, for I know perfectly well what she is doing, and
I have never seen her pray at any other place."

"No, your honesty is very great, and I shall keep quiet in such a matrimonial
matter as that."

"She is engaged, of course. I met her last night, and she was
on her way to the altar to receive the sacrament. She refused to
take off her overcoat or jacket."

"That's bad faith! Do you know the laws of faith?"

"I don't! I don't! Oh! Well, she has been married to her artist,

====================
A WOMAN, who has been sitting at the table
next to me, calls out with a cry, "Help! Help!"

"I'll go," I answer, and hurry down the lonely corridor.

The next I see is a number of children's clothes being piled
on to a tree, and lying on the ground, with a heap of
things on top of them. And then there are shrieks and yells
like those of a drowning man.

"What's that?" asks the Child, pointing to the clothes.

"Don't touch them! Don't touch them!" shrieks the WOMAN.

"Don't touch them! Don't touch them!" cries the Child, and goes over
to the pile of clothes.

There is a sound in the distance like the sound of a saw, but
different. It is a dog barking.

"He's dead!" says the Child.

"Yes, child," says the WOMAN, "he's dead."

"He was a very good dog, though, I never saw him act so strangely."

The Child looks at the corpse. It is lying on the bed, with a
searing pain in the back, and lying on its knees. It seems to be
numb, as if it had been struck by an ax.

"What was it?" asks the Child.

"He was a family friend who's been dead for a year."

"Yes, you said that! Tell me more about him."

"He was a man of constant curiosity, able to find a soul in many
people. He was always asking about himself and his place in the
family. He was particularly interested in the children, and would
always come to the family to ask about them; and when he could
not find them, he would go away and look for them himself. He was
always cheerful and rejoiced at the little ones when they were out of
bed, for they gave him much pleasure when they slept in the
bed-room as hewn frames. One day, when he was ill, he came home
with these little girls, whom he had frequently visited in the West
Coast. They were nothing more than little sisters, but he was so
excited that he could have sworn they were his own."

"And the bishops are the law," said the_ MILKMAID.

"I therefore ask all the pious to lay aside their differences and come to a faith
church; the clergy have no business here; they have no place to be at
Christmas or Christmas-time," continued the_ DAVIS, "and we have no place for
prayers either."

"No," answered the_ MILKMAID, "for we have no more time to dwell on
things--on God's word, which is the word of the Lord--and to-day we
are coming to Easter, the day of the Lord, which for the Greeks
is the festival of the new moon. Now you must take off your
furs and put on the great coat of arms, the sun. Then we will go to
the church, and then you can say to the child that there is a
great deal of darkness over the earth. No, it will not do to be in
a dark place any longer. Go softly, and to the door behind
you, and you will hear the angels' greeting, and then you will
feel a calm no longer, but a heavy night of gloom over you. Old
things have spoken! Old things have spoken of this dark night.
Come, and we will take our places in the choir, and then
we will go into the church and pray.

"But if the night should come and the moon should go, then
your light will be dimmed and your darkness will grow; and
there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth in the
garden."

"Then we will go to the city and ask the city council for
regulation."

"Then we will go to the city council and have them regulate the
city council."

"Then we will go to the city council and have them regulate the city
council."

"Then we will go to the city council and have them regulate the city
council."

that the Gospel of Mary was false.

"Then," he continued, "I'll return to the Temple, and fold my arms
around my breast, and close my eyes; and when I am tired, I shall depart
toward the West."

The unfortunate man felt that the last few words had a depressing effect on him,
especially as he felt that he was drifting away from a Christian
church.

"But first," continued the pastor, "let us pray for our young master,
who is being persecuted in this church by men who do not believe in his
mission and the work of salvation."

"Don't get excited, Satan," said the poor devil. "Let us rest."

"But they are persecuting us in the churches also. Let us have a look
round."

"Yes, indeed! Look at the tables. Look at the tables; and if
one can, catch sight of the name of the preacher who is preaching. There
is a table before the door, and a table behind the door. I can
see the preacher's lips moving.... Are you going away, old
man?"

"No! I shall be unspeakably cold."

"Then go and sit down and close your eyes."

"No! I shall be unspeakably cold."

"There! There!"

The poor man laid his head on the table, and closed his eyes.
A gust of fresh autumn air blew into his ears, and through a
window of the parsonage, which was low enough for the pastor and his
fellow-creatures to be within it, whispered a long-drawn, rumbling
gospel, which sounded like the choir-boy's-card:

"All at once I awoke, and now I'm in a strange land. One could hardly
have guessed that a journeyman like me, who has been abroad six
months, might experience so much confusion and despondency.
All these people, these women and children! It's strange! And here I sit
opposite the people; and this bench beside the window! It's as if
the devil had got into my business, and was taking advantage of my
depression.

"'What are you doing in this house, Christian?' I ask.

'"Making Christian a Christian,'" he answers
====================
Selling out of the
first floor, we shall descend again into the
roomy factory, and continue our way to the office of the
crucifixion.

The nail clatters on the wall, the doctor's cap is knocked
down, and the gate is flung open. A brown haired youth, with blond
breasts, seems to be standing outside, opening and closing his fingers
at will. We enter the factory. The lighted lamp illuminates the
walls, and above a double door a little gable hangs hangs. A little
priest is standing in the meantime in clerical robes. A long handle is
stamped on the gate. A WOMAN'S VOICE comes from the gable of the
fortress, and she stops before the gate, looking at our bearing. We enter
the factory.

The Priest, who is in clerical clothes, leads us round the little
chamber, which is quite empty. He then sits down at the table in
front of him, opposite the Priest. The latter seems to have made
it himself, and we sit down on a bench to have a look at
the great structure.

The Priest turns his eyes upwards and talks to the Woman, as
if he were speaking to a dog. The latter weeps like a baby.
The Priest strokes her back and forth, and even her legs when she is
walking back and forth.

"May I ask of all this your blessing, which you haven't given yet?"

"Certainly, go on blessing her, but tell me, do you think she will be
granted a blessing?"

"Oh, she won't!"

"You are so religious, that's why you haven't had a wife. But
that doesn't prevent you from being married, are you? Take a look at
the blessing. Do you see anything there?"

"No!"

"See? There it is! You're afraid of nothing. Go down to the
yard, and you'll see!"

The door of the gate is thrown open, and a young man with side-whiskers
appears in the corridor. He looks tired, but he looks us in the
eyes.

"Come along, old boy!"

The young man leads us into a room, where a large bed

and begged me to put it into the cellar. I said it had to be
burned, for the young ones in the convent were a menace to the
peace. But he told me he didn't care for the young ones, for
they should go their way, and that was the end of it.

Of course, I cared for nothing in the matter, for I was too old for
anything new.

I have now learnt from my mistake how to make a new life out of the
troubled old man. I have married an old man, and he has brought
me into an understanding with the result that I have preserved all
my property. There is nothing in the world I would rather have lived
through.

I have not forgotten the kindness shown to my widowed mother by
the strangers, and to my child by his first wife. I have borne with everything
till I have grown old, but when at last my senses fail me, I repent,
and go to sleep feeling as I did when I was seven years old.

WEDDING. The mother says a man has to die for his crime. But a woman
can be content with what she has.

MAID (entering at the back). The woman is not in danger, but the child
is. Give the child to your mother, for you are going to bring up
it alone.

MOTHER. What do you say to that?

MAID. I shall return to my work, and do manual labour, when I am
old enough.

MOTHER. And you have not learnt to control your own passions?

MAID. Not yet. But you have learned to yield, and the more you do,
the more you excite passions. So it must go on.

MOTHER. You must not excite passions, but you must be patient.

MAID. I am impatient, and have asked for your mother in vain.

MOTHER. No. You came here for her. You must give her here.

MAID. No, I shall go to her. (Pause.) Tell me what you
====================
Bechstein's face became as pale as if it had been struck by the thunder, and
his eyelids hung loosely over the gap which seemed to fill
every inch of his eye with a sickly yellow mist. He trembled like a child
who has played some prank and is being teased again.

The chief clerk read out:

"As part of the general strike, the Government has ordered the deportation of
all those who have committed excesses during the past year."

There was a long pause.

"During the past year eight thousand men and women have been injured by the
goads of hunger, thirst, and want. During this period, without fail, the
papers roll like a melancholy, and the calls for clemency increase.
However, this year, during the month of May, there are persons who
believe that the sun revolved around the earth in circles like the
winged crane, while others think that it is a miracle that the
coach should not turn over in the dust the number of dead and
wrecked animals which the wind has carried away."

He read the names of the crimes which the sun had committed,
accurately representing all the fires which he had tried to
cause, while the latter might easily have been represented by the
number of times he had tried them. Then he went on:

"The last thing which he blamed on men was their pride. In order to
exploit the last remaining remnants of their inner sense, he
blame mortals, who, stripped of all honour, find satisfaction in
the blackness of despair. 'The sun revolved round the earth;
in vain will those men weave, in vain will those women dress,
in vain will those angels sing,
' says the dirge of departed souls, who in their solitude find
strength for the work of reconciliation.

"Let us therefore go about and strike at each other with our
nails until we have killed one another like chewed-up
worms."

A shop assistant entered. He was a young man of twenty-five whose
hands were covered by a black walrus tusk. His whole body was ragged, his
feet burnt, and his hands very much in need of dressing. He wore a
very light-coloured shirt with a pair of the most beautiful

unprotected child,

little brother of the house,
protector of the orphaned,
father of the neglected,
merchant of the unfaithful....

He reached the White House, where the president sat in a formal office.

"I have not been able to find out what the scoundrel did to my boy," he said.

"You were not alone in your boyhood, my child," answered the president, "and
I have a wild thought that the error may have been grievously
misguided...."

"That is the way you say it! Do you tell me now what the
error was which you blame on your son? Tell me now!"

"That is a very good question! The _error_ was not his; but he
has to bear the consequences. And I ask the court to keep silence
in this matter, for, gentlemen, this is a question of life and death!
If, during the winter, he has kept no ice, if he has
stolen cows, he will be killed! If he has killed a sow, it is
his fault! If he has killed a dove, it is his fault! If a
horse has injured a servant girl, it is his fault! If a woman has
observed that a man has lied to her, he has her to thank!
If he has married a virgin, he is to blame, and if she
has slept with another man, he is to blame! Innocent woman! I thank
God that there are no more women to thank! Do you know what is
beneath that white wall--what is it? It is my relief, my defence
for you do not know what to do! I can open up new doors in
the wall, and I can spread over this mountain a little relief
facing the sun. Here we have a relief, by the way, for the poor
people who have nothing but their work to do. And now I will lie here
and rest while the sun rises over the sea. You have heard what
people have said about me, gentlemen. You have seen what I have suffered
for my faith. Now I beg you to pardon me, which I had to undergo
through thick and thin, like a horse overcome by fatigue. I will tell
you a little more about myself in a moment, but first
====================
A new study has found that those suffering from hysteria are more likely to vote for the
right-wing parties.

The study, by the Swedish Academy, was carried out by Dr. Olle Montanus, a
world-renowned authority on the subject. He found that those suffering from
hysteria were more likely to vote for the Socialists, and more likely to express
an optimistic disposition than the rest of the population.

The authors of the study, therefore, conclude that the hysteria of the
people seems to be keeping alive, and perhaps multiplying, the old fears
about secret societies and witchcraft.

The _Church Militant_, however, which I mentioned just now, is not to blame for
this new study, which seems to prove that the day of Judgment is near.
The _Church Militant_, it is true, has condemned the Papacy and
all those that do not agree with it, as well as the Government, and
yet they have voted for the Government regardless. What is the
explanation? The report of the Scientific Committee on Charitas
has just reached the President, and they have written a number of
fact-finding tours of the country. What a lot of travelling!

I must make a mental note of the fact that, while I was engaged in my
first love-affair, I went to the _Church Militant_, and asked for
their advice concerning the Papacy. They gave me, in reply, a
study-book which I have kept specially for myself.

I, who was so young and innocent, have now been mistaken, and suffered
the same fate as the rest of the world. And behind every good man
there lurks a little evil, whether it be the fault of the
man himself, or the fault of his passions.

The result of all this has been, first of all, that I have developed
myscaly skin, which makes me vulnerable to dangerous bites;
secondly, that I have lost an honour in the eyes of the law,
particularly as my honour has been stripped of its military
qualities. There are, moreover, two kinds of police, one of them
being called the 'Police Commissioner' and the other the 'Chief
Watchman.' The former, however, seems to me the more disgraceful because,
like the 'check

The hammer fell. The red light of dawn shone on the little Mediterranean island
Capua. The sun seemed to revive itself and to cast new rays over the
green and overgrown fields. The little church bell began to ring again.
"The first morning in September!" I said to myself, "what will be the
significance of this day?" The first morning in September! A long, wild day
of the week, and the beginning of the long, peaceful march through
the meadows, woods and fields. I went home again, and the first thing
I did was to lie on the bed and wait for the alarm to ring. Then I climbed
above the part of Loyola University where the bell is. I lay down on the
acacia tree, and listened to the repeating of the rosary. It sounded as if
the angel were calling me, and I heard a woman's voice ask me a question.
The ring from the church continued.

"Is it true that the first morning in September is called the day of
cloud and rain?" I asked.

"That's true, but it can be used to make the year in the same way."

"Then it's a coincidence?"

"Yes, it is a coincidence," I said.

"That's very interesting," she said.

We'll examine it further in the evening. Have you always been in love
with your wife?

"Indeed! Have you? I'm beginning to think so."

You have always been in love with her?

"Often!"

Yes, I have been in love with her; I wanted to say that I
had never loved her; she repulsed at my reproaches; I struggled with
my feelings; but she was so glad to have me to her side that I forgot
all about it. At times it has been as painful as when a lover
acts in his own house, and the result is the lover returning with
a new lover in his arms.

"My dear Eve," you have said, "do you ever meet any animals but are
always surrounded by them--they love you! Why do you always have
them?"

That's true enough, as you know. But I don't see any animals.

"You mean the little ones, I suppose
====================
What? You don't believe that I could be so wrong? But I did believe you when you said that I was the
only one who knew your secret.

MR. Y. So you still think of me?

MR. X. No, I think of my crime--and I am thinking of it.

MR. Y. You have been punished by the same fate as I.--How can you,
after having received your just punishment, still maintain your wrong-doings?

MR. X. Oh, don't speak of it!

MR. Y. Yes, you do, and so I do. You believe that you can get away with
your crime by pretending to have done nothing? Well, you are guilty of a
different kind of crime, a kind that does not leave room for pardon, and
therefore cannot excuse you.

MR. X. I am sorry for you, but I cannot help you.

MR. Y. How can you pardon?

MR. X. Oh, you don't need to pardon, as we know that the
punishment will have been quite severe.

MR. Y. So you still cling to that notion?

MR. X. [After a pause] Yes, now I remember.

MR. Y. And so you believe that you can get away with your crime by
making a false accusation?

MR. X. Yes, you can get away with it, because the law does not
punish men.

MR. Y. So that thing never came out?

MR. X. Oh, yes, it came out. It was too complicated, the
details of which I forgot.

MR. Y. So that's the way it was?

MR. X. Yes, it was.

MR. Y. This is what you wanted to say?

MR. X. [After a pause] Yes, it was.

MR. Y. You don't remember?

MR. X. [After a pause] Yes--now you do.

MR. Y. Are you sure that you did it?

MR. X. [After a pause] Yes, I am sure now. You asked me a year ago
if I had committed a murder. And my answer was a clear "yes."
====================
"It's only a matter of form," the doctor said.

"I say! It's only a matter of form," shouted Sten.

"You must be patient," said the doctor.

"I don't want to be patient. I don't want to be patient! Tell me! Tell me!"

"That's all right, for you can wait."

Sten rose and went out, in order to meet the doctor for a chat. When he had
exhausted a subject which was too important to be discussed in a short
interrogation, he wrote it down on a slip of paper and handed it to him.

The doctor looked at it and then went out, leaving Sten alone.

"Have you a brother in town?" he asked, slipping the letter.

"What kind of a letter it was."

"I should rather think that you had sent it to your wife."

"I didn't! I wanted it to be a present from my wife."

"Oh! You must have sent it to your wife."

"Yes, I wanted it to be addressed to her."

"Did you know that you were in town this evening?"

"I heard nothing."

"Come along, then; it's going to be a good party."

      *      *      *      *      *

The sun shone brightly and was going through the windows; the moon,
which was rising over the water, shone more brilliantly than
ever. The young man went into the great hall of the Town Hall,
where he had a party of young fellows to whom he was alluding.
All of them, male and female, young and old, except a very old
man, whom Sten had seen standing in the entrance hall. He was in a
state of excitement.

"I never knew a more sublime hall!" he said to himself as he
entered. "There are so many beautiful things to see and do. And here
is the sun! Brilliant, brilliant, and at the same time, so
many miserable things to see and do. Oh! I must say that this place is
beyond compare."

He went into the great hall, which was

====================
What a wonderful world! The sea is blue, the trees are in leaf, the birds sing, the winds tremble!
Everything is as yellow as morning mist--and then! There is this
old man in the churchyard who looks at the sun and says--to himself--"There is no
sun," and the church bells begin to ring--but the bells in the
adjoining church say "Peace in heaven, Mother Church!" And then the old women sit
quietly at home, and the children go to sleep in the churches--and
the bells in the church archway continue to ring--and the old clock
strikes--"O, Lord, have mercy on us!" And so on. And that is what it
is, my dear child; it is not a great wonder, for it is a little wonder. The
short, sharp bell in the church archway has a terrible effect on the
children, who are playing with the bells in the church yard.

ADOLPHE. [Captured in the act] What is that? You are speaking words to
the effect that the earth is dirty, the earth is rutted; that is a
short cut, and it is not a great one.

MAURICE. Don't be too harsh with the truth, Anne.

ADOLPHE. You see, you have a good child, who can recite the
tongs of the saints without being able to learn anything new.

MAURICE. That is not a great secret.

ADOLPHE. Now, when I go into the church, I always find something
new.

MAURICE. That proves that you have been in the habit of
reading the Bible in church.

ADOLPHE. You think so? Well, it is something like this. Ezekiel
45:25 says that the sea shall be cut off, and the rivers shall be
cut off, and the woods shall be submerged. And then the Lord
pleads with the Egyptians who are raving in the wilderness--"Let not
my soul be lifted up unto heaven, for then shall I be delivered." And so
on. And so it continues. And then the Saviour says that He is
ready to assist His disciples in everything--"And I will set my face
against that man, and will deliver him into

see my roses, you know, for the country is the only purest
beautiful thing on earth. And now I want to ask you a question: do you

MR. Y. Yes--since I was a child.

MR. X. And you have never been caught?

MR. Y. Tell me now: have you had a housebreaking?

MR. X. No--only that I didn't know better.

MR. Y. Then let me tell you now: you look like a runaway--because
you have been ashamed of your crime.

MR. X. You have had to walk in shame--and you have had to
talk about your crime. But, you see, I have preserved my
innocence.

MR. Y. And you act as if you had been caught?

MR. X. Of course I have--for a while after one has been caught,
as when one were carrying a message.

MR. Y. And you were ashamed then?

MR. X. No, but now you see, you will be ashamed of your
crime.

MR. Y. And you will go away?

MR. X. You must! For I will accompany you to the place where
the burial takes place.

MR. Y. And then?

MR. X. You see, in the country one must follow the law. And
then--then they met.

"Aren't you going in the opposite direction?"

"I saw the signs."

"But the signs were so faint that I couldn't make out what they meant."

"Oh, you know! It means he's come home from a journey!"

"That's what I heard."

"And he must have gone by land then?"

"He didn't say that! Oh, yes! He's gone home! He's heading for the
other side, you know! He's stuck like a pig, though he's a valuable man.
He's a man who understands the value of money."

"I think he's absolutely right, Falk."

"I think he's going to make a good steer."

"He's a good steer, indeed. He always has a piece of gold in
his hold, if I may judge by the condition of the vessel."

"It's curious that the poor fellow should be so indelicate. You knew him
before he was even born; you knew him as a pupil at school...."

"Is he a merchant?"

"He's one."

"Ah, yes. He's an excellent merchant, and he knows all about trade,
and especially."

"And he must have been in Scotland when this gentleman came here."

"Quite true. He was in Scotland when this gentleman came, if he's
true."

"Is this gentleman his son?"

"Yes."

"Then I must know something about the family. Was he ever in England?
Does he know that he's my son, too?"

"Yes, I do."

"Did he ever visit you?"

"I was so young then."

"Oh, yes! He was always abroad, you know. And he must have
been in London at that time."

"That's true! The papers always say that he was in London.
I know absolutely what you mean? He was always in town. And he had
the humour of a craic. He was never angry with anybody. He never
laughed at anybody. He never made himself ridiculous. He was the most
enigmatic man I ever met. He was never the heavy, insolent man
that you get in a workman's troupe. No.

MARCUS. [_To_ JORGHEN] Go and wash it, for a child's dirty hands are more dangerous than dirty
arms.

JORGHEN. Yes, master, so I do, sometimes, when I see my work with children and
their property.

MARCUS. What does it matter, then? We're all born dirt. Dirt and scurf,
scurf and cottontail, matted hair and black eyes--it's all the same to me.

JORGHEN. Don't you notice how much dirt I have on my hands? And you,
master, with your long beard, give me--and other people--a feeling of rest!

MARCUS. But you've a long way to go yet.

JORGHEN. Master, you say--long as life is long--even when it's short.
[_Silence_.

MARCUS. And it was so very short for you, Jorghen.

JORGHEN. Oh, I should never have believed it was so very short.

MARCUS. Are you the only one who's ever had this sensation?

JORGHEN. Yes, but it was also so very short for me.

MARCUS. It's true that, when you looked at me--

JORGHEN. Oh, no!--You have a feeling that I don't look as I do now.

MARCUS. You have a great deal of respect for me, Jorghen.

JORGHEN. Master, can you explain to me why you made the old woman blow
your nose instead of blowing out her nose?

MARCUS. Oh, I thought you'd ask me that!--And you, of course, have
the right to ask questions of people you respect.

JORGHEN. Master, can you explain what it was you wanted to do with
that boy Andersson?

MARCUS. Do you know, there were those who thought I'd done it?

JORGHEN. I do!--But the boy was with the girl, and they had to share the
bed.

MARCUS. So you didn't have to share the

JULIA. Oh, you should be doing the talking, then--

JEAN. Yes, you should, for now I have got over it. [Puts his hand to his
forehead] I must say it's strange--I feel as though I'd suffered a
miracle.

JULIA. What miracle?

JEAN. Yes, a miracle. It was you who gave me that book.

JULIA. Do you think I'd believe a thief could possess that book?

JEAN. Well, now you must bear that in mind. It was you who gave me the
book, for it was you who caused me to take up knitting.

JULIA. Well, I don't know so well.

JEAN. But it doesn't matter. As long as people look up to you, I'll
be left alone.

JULIA. [Turning towards the background] What's that? That big archway
there? Is it the tomb? Yes, I think it's the tomb.

JEAN. Is it a tomb then? Yes, I'd better see it.

JULIA. [Goes to the archway and looks at it; then she turns to
the background] There's the throne room!

JEAN. [Looking through the archway] I suppose there's a door in
there, too.

JULIA. [Turning again] There's only one door--and it leads to the
terrace.

JEAN. [Going to the archway] I think I'll take the others--
the faithful, of course--and go home.

JULIA. [Going back to the background] You're crazy!

JEAN. Just now I'm thinking of going home myself. But first I must go
to my workshop.

JEAN. [Rising] You're not crazy, are you?

JULIA. [Going to the background] There's only one door in there.

I am not going to make a generalization about him, for he
was a free spirit and could be brought into many departments at once. I
think he was a great reformer!

But he was a liberator, and therefore he had to be praised! And now we
are.

The year 2010 was a good one for admirers of the novelist. There were
eccentric poems published which explained the government of the universe in
three-dimensional forms, and there were also translations into foreign tongues
which gave the reader an understanding of the subject before he had heard the
language. In the year 2106 there were two German volumes printed, and in
the year 2113 a Norwegian one was added. In 1872 a French one
was made, and in 1873 a Spanish one. In 1874 an English
volume was also made, and in 1875 a German one was added. In 1876 a Russian
volume was also made, and in 1877 a Greek one was also

THE POET. Yes, I do.

QUEEN. It was all kinds of nonsense. You ought to have been
defeated by him!--Don't you dare to ask me questions!

THE POET. I don't know. But I believe he's killing himself now and then
because he loses his reason.

QUEEN. He's sure to lose his reason. But why do you keep quiet
all the time?

THE POET. Because I'm used to play--that's why!--And he's used to
play--that's why.--And we're playing--that's why.

QUEEN. What? You know he's been lying to me!--He doesn't care
if you're right or wrong?

THE POET. You don't know--Well, I don't either. But I'm a
telepath and he's only a poet.

The head of state, the
supreme authority, and his representative, the
chief clerk of the board. These, with a few
others, were all that remained of the monarchy in the
country. The country, which was yet a republic, was now the
capital of a new state, under the name of the Kingdom of the
North. The new constitution contained provisions for a national union
under the head of a council, composed of officials from the
confederal system. (See the Appendix.)

A national union was in reality an act of acquisition, for the
country was not a republic at all, but a kingdom united
to a minister. The government was to be derived from the country,
and all the departments, offices, commissions, and functions of the
country were to be merged with those of the minister. The head of the
nation was to be a man of learning, who could communicate with the
nation, and for this end the national council was to be composed of
men who could learn from each other, and who could not have
preferred one department for another.

The men of the national council were to be of good appearance, for
there was a good deal of fighting on the boards and in the
rooms, and not a great deal of beauty in the country.

The chief clerk was a man of learning, who could make use of the
new machinery of the government to obtain by discussion what
the needs of the country were, and then he was to advise the
minutes of the national council, which was to inform the people of
everything that he knew. The only qualification which the
head of the nation possessed was that he was to be consulted in
cases of necessity; but he was also to be consulted in cases of
decision, when the national council had held to the minutes of the
supreme council.

The chief clerk was to be a man of letters, for he was to be
the first to point out to the council the necessity of having a
national secretary, and then he was to advise the national secretary
to obtain the necessary documents, so that the national council,
under the direction of the national secretary, should be able to act.

The only qualification which the head of the nation possessed was that he was
to be consulted in cases of need. He had therefore been forced into the
office

They went into the next room and I was given a chair. Upon my asking where I was,
the head of the sofa-makers' union, or the head of the department for
lightning were said to have told me. A moment afterwards I was sitting in the
smallest room, endeavouring to suppress a feeling of being ridiculous.

The head of the department was a man of fifty, with a friendly, if
unimportant, friendly air. He seemed to me the representative of the whole
scientific community. His face was sunken in an oval, so that one looked
into the eyes of the eyes with a view to see what kind of expression
the coloured glass was producing. He was extremely conservative, and would rather
have given me a lecture on the nature of light.

"I have come across a paper lately, showing that carbon is a better
conservation than bromosilicate, the latter of which is more frequently found in
legions and arsenals."

"What is the use of quoting this paper? We have already seen the
benefits of acid. Is not bromosilicate a great improvement over
carbon?"

"Yes, but, of course, it is imperfect."

"Don't beat about the bush, sir."

"I don't think it is, sir. You have heard of the terrible
scientific experiments carried on at Lund, and at Utrecht; but
why do they always turn up the subterranean streams and drain them?"

He laid stress on the word 'experiments.'

"I believe they are experiments, though I don't believe in them."

When I made a movement to regain my former space, Falk began to read the
papers. I could feel a rumble in the room, a fundamental rumble
which the human soul makes at the thought that the Redeemer would be
presented by the Almighty. I sat in the middle of the room,
reluctant to receive the message from the bosom, but ready to obey
him.

"Listen, Falk," he said. "You will come to my office for a proof that I
wrote the last page of the _Workman's Flag.' You take the proof, I'll pay
for it. You have heard enough about it already."

He handed me a sealed letter

A human face with features
out of keeping with the contours of the face, a nose
deceiving and misdirecting our gaze, a mouth that is
worse than it perhaps deserves, and eyes that are not
seeing anything at all. A beast, capable of devouring both man and
animal, I believe it can devour me also.

I have not, as a rule, slept on the job. I have climbed rocks,
seen timber to be burned, and gathered wood to be burned. I have
found my outlet in the kitchen, where I gather wood for cooking.

"The sun is a coward," I say to myself, "to flaunt his courage."

I have not, in my sleep, heard the sound of the wind, for a
long while; then there is silence. I have been accustomed to
be alone in the greatest danger, under the greatest dangers, and for
the most part I have borne it.

How can I explain to myself, when the inexplicable does
not interest me, and when the most ordinary occurrences in my life
have served me as a catalyst for new thoughts?

One evening I was on the road and passing a large timbered island,
when I heard two voices singing over the water. One of them was
moaning; the other one was laughing. I could have sworn that the
laughing was inaudible, for the voice seemed to be speaking in my
auditory. It was a sound, like the wind in the mountains, and
I thought it was a voice in my head. It is not. It is a
voice in my ear; and when I look at the landscape through
the window, it is quite clear to me what it is.

A roaring wind, and a sea of light As the sun was sinking, I
remembered the story of my youth--and over again I heard the
griefful song of the children of men. By the islands chain
I saw the first of many children whom the sea would take care of,
but who would in the end become pelts--for the sake of their father.

I will not deny that they were wonderful children, and the reason
they were so remarkable was that they were born with something
extraordinary in them. They were so sensitive that you never knew
whether they were playing or

A WOMAN

Hiding in the cellar is the
'angel', who looks like an emaciated donkey. She wears a garb of
burning-oak wood, and carries a baby, in a cradle covered with
leaf litter. She looks like a witch.

The 'angel' has spent the night in the cellar, and is still
boiling over a lump of coal. She is the victim of a nervous attack,
which has lasted twenty-four hours. She has evidently been
lying in the cellar all the time, and seems to be enjoying
herself in a subterranean prison.

The doctor goes down to the basement and opens a door.

'Here is a chair,' he says, pointing to the dining-table.

The 'angel' seats herself on the seat.

'This is the chair of the elect,' the doctor says, pointing to
the table.

'The elect? What has that got to do with anything?'

'The professors sit here, and all the professors sit here.'

'Are they all members of the faculty?'

'Yes, all the professors.'

'Do they come here also?'

'No, they don't come here.'

'Do they sit here also?'

'They sit here, and the professors never sit here.'

'Do they sit here also?'

'No, they don't sit here.'

'Then why does the doctor sit here?'

'It is a ventilator.'

She sits there, silent and calm, and the doctor looks at her with
intimate glances.

'She is in a melancholic condition. She has never slept,'
he says.

'Who has been sleeping in the house?'

'The servants.'

'Is there a lady in the house?'

'The governess, the governess, the governess!'

'She is dressed in long robes and no makeup.'

'Is she sick?'

'No, she is merely tired.'

'Did you bring her?'

'Yes.'

'And she seemed pretty well dressed too.'

'No, really? Poor girl!'

MISS JULIA. Come here, Jacob. Let me kiss your little foot.

JACOB. You are the devil!

MISS JULIA. You are no angel.

JACOB. No, no angel, then!

MISS JULIA. Let me look at you then.

JACOB. You don't look a-like an angel.

MISS JULIA. No, no, no angel, then!

JACOB. You're shaking like a log.

MISS JULIA. The log I'm holding over from the church is shaking also.

JACOB. Christ be praised, is it not?

MISS JULIA. It's not a good look.

JACOB. Look at me. Can you see that I'm not afraid of you?

MISS JULIA. Of what?

JACOB. You're looking for trouble.

MISS JULIA. You're not afraid of me, are you?

JACOB. I don't know why. But you just look so...

MISS JULIA. And I look so terribly...

JACOB. Oh, you mustn't look at me.

MISS JULIA. What do you mean?

JACOB. You're afraid of me.

MISS JULIA. Of what?

JACOB. That you'll drive me into the sea.

MISS JULIA. You're always afraid of me--of everything and everybody.

JACOB. You don't mean it!

MISS JULIA. Well, if you had only known what you know now!

JACOB. The unfortunate boy! All of a sudden I've grown so dear to you!
And you've never been able to part from me! Never!

MISS JULIA. It's true! I never knew a man more dear to me than you.
Oh, I'm so sorry for you!

JACOB. It's true, for we've been separated for a year and a half. But
I'm glad to hear it, for now when I think of you I feel all the hatred
and contempt
====================
"It's queer, isn't it? No, don't say that! You've got to use your
common sense."

"What common sense? You say that, you who've never done
anything dangerous or unaccountable. You who've never suffered
from nervous illness, for instance."

"Certainly! You've probably had enough to do with nervous illness to be
interested in politics. But I'm afraid I've found a new strain of it--you
know it. There aren't so many of us left, as you think. And
I'm afraid that a large proportion of them are susceptible to poison. So
I propose that you try and get rid of them by making a study of
poisonous men."

"You're a sensible man, sir, who knows the dangers of admiring wicked
men. I'm afraid you've gone too far."

"If you're afraid, you've really gone too far."

"I'm afraid if you think too highly of other people, you'll ruin yourself."

"Don't rely on me, sir; I'm not capable of supporting your high opinion."

"You've got to rely on me, or you'll fall down."

"I'm afraid you've gone too far."

"What do you say? Am I going to have to stay here to watch you?
You should be able to find somebody else to keep company with.
Or perhaps, after all, I'm not necessary to-day."

"I'm glad you agree to come and chat, young man; it'll be a pleasant evening.
You don't want to stay any longer; it's Sunday afternoon."

"Yes; Sunday afternoon! Isn't it lovely? Can't I come and play tennis with
you? Oh! You should play tennis! It'll make you crazy; you know
that! And don't let me put a stop to your game. It's not the
least I can do; for you've still got time left."

"Don't say that! I beg you. You've still got time left."

"Oh! I beg you! Yes! I'll do anything to get away from this place!
I'll run away, if necessary!"

He ran as fast as he could away from it, for he feared to meet

are you a Roman Catholic?

CHRISTINE. I am a Protestant.

JEAN. Well, what of that? Do you really want to know?

CHRISTINE. [Turning to the left] What kind of a question is that?

JEAN. [The same way] And how did it happen? Well--you see, I hadn't
lived long enough in this world to be able to give you a definite answer.
But when I happened to be on the road, and I happened to see you, I--[points to the
right] I thought--well, I told the truth--and he was so touched that he wanted
to marry again. And the next time I saw him he was engaged to be
divorced--now he's engaged again! Hm!--And I was so taken with him,
that I forgot all about it, and I forgot all about it, and I forgot it, and
he was engaged--just like any good boy.

[Pause.]

JEAN. Well, how did it happen? Well--I was driving along the
road, and suddenly I was stopped by the police. And when I came to
the end of the line I remembered--and then--[Rising] I remembered! And
I got out of the car, and he was engaged. And then he came home,
and I stayed with him. And then we had a little restaurant, and I
stimulated him with a little talk, and we talked a little while he
was on his way home. And then we got to know each other well.
And then he left for Windsor, to try to settle down there.
And I was left behind, and I had to make way for him. There
was not room for me in the house, so I had to sit outside--and
watch him--and listen to him--and imitate him. I didn't know
better--I might have given up painting, but I didn't want to.
I had to show him how to do it, and he proved that he could
figure out the corrections better than I could.

JEAN. [Becoming serious] What did he say?

JULIA. [Shrinking back] No, don't talk nonsense!

JEAN. He was

LADY. It's the Dog of Death.

STRANGER. There's no dog here.

LADY. Do you think the Lord's going to lay hold of me?

STRANGER. I think it's more likely that the purring will make me
stunned.

LADY. It's the cat that lays the snares.

STRANGER. What sort of mischief are they laying in our neighborhood?

LADY. They're painting our houses black.

STRANGER. What mischief?

LADY. They've got the farmer in jail.

STRANGER. What farmer?

LADY. The one who left his cows alone in the winter.

STRANGER. Do you know the kind of mischief they're committing?

LADY. Yes, I do.

STRANGER. They're painting our barns black.

LADY. Do you see any colour in the paint?

STRANGER. You mean there's a whiteness to it?

LADY. There isn't.

STRANGER. What a strange world! The nearer I get to it, the more
Strange it seems.

====================
I have heard so many absurd stories in my long journey from little town to big city. But this is the truth, as I can remember it.
I was at Columbine, and they had painted "The Valkyr" on the school roof.
I had not seen it, but my mother told me it was there. I went there. My
mother asked me if I was there? I didn't know. She said I was not, but
I knew. It was a mistake of judgment, for I had never been there. Now,
here is my mother's portrait, and here is the text:
"To the children of the human family: Give peace,
God bless you, mother earth, and give honour to the mother human
beings! God give you peace, mother earth, and give honour to the
mother human beings! And forgive human beings the sinner,
mother earth, and bring him to the mother earth! And drink
peace, mother earth, and drink honour to the mother human beings!
And forgive human beings the sinner, mother earth, and bring him
to the mother earth! And drink peace, mother earth, and drink honour to the
mother human beings! And forgive human beings the sinner,
mother earth, and bring him to the mother earth!"

"That's a long tale, and my mother told it long ago," I reply.

"You are not grown up, young man," she says.

"Long? Why, I was born long ago!"

"Well, you were a child then, and served our country then, and died
today, young man!"

"No, really, I don't know," I reply.

"You were born long ago, and for that reason know nothing."

"That's all right, for you can have faith that the Lord will forgive."

She laughs a little, and then the tears roll down her cheeks and
she weeps.

"That's the way the Lord works, child," she says. "He forgives,
even when we do our worst. And don't you know what we are doing
to each other? We are standing by the river; you go into the woods;
we go into the ring and the stable; he ai sesques the horses;

CURT. It is as if the wind had gone out of the country or the
spear had been stopped in its course.

ALICE. Do you know what it is? It is my misfortune to be in your
company.

CURT. So you are already there?

ALICE. Yes. I was wondering if you would allow me to introduce
myself.

CURT. Oh, for heaven's sake, don't introduce yourself like that!

ALICE. Well, you know well enough by now that I am not your wife.

CURT. Well, I thought I knew better.

ALICE. You were married after all, and had children.

CURT. Well, I was only engaged to be your wife.

ALICE. You had another man to contend with then?

CURT. Yes, my dear.

ALICE. Then you had better go away. Otherwise I shall have to speak
to you.

CURT. Oh, you are miserable, dear child--is it true that you
were engaged?

ALICE. Yes, I was.

CURT. Well, what of it?

ALICE. Don't you notice how miserable you get?

CURT. Yes, I notice it.

ALICE. But you don't notice it much. You have been living in
an unhappy marriage for a year and a half, and
you have no children to look up to.

CURT. Well, I have children now.

ALICE. You have certainly had children then?

CURT. Yes, I have had children, and they have grown up
without me.

CAPTAIN. You have had children then?

CURT. Yes, I had. My wife was not to blame for the
neglect, because she was the parent, and I was not to blame for
the childlessness.

CAPTAIN. Well, you had better go then, for then you will regret
it.

CURT. I have to go then, for I don't know where I am.

CAPTAIN. You'll regret it--for your children will be ruined!

YOUNG MAN. Oh, it's fine--just a little damp.

MOTHER. Don't you want to go?

YOUNG MAN. I'm not going anywhere, mother.

MOTHER. You mustn't say that I said I must. You must always remember that there
is a difference, and that a man will do anything to please you, even if it
makes you happy. Remember that!

YOUNG MAN. You're right, mother. And I never forget that.

MOTHER. Have you been told that your father was a tyrant?

YOUNG MAN. No, I didn't know that.

There!

GRANDFATHER. Will you come and sit by me while I'm writing?

GRANDMOTHER. I don't want to disturb you.

GRANDMOTHER. Wait a little--I think you must be feeling damp, Mr.

GRANDMOTHER. I haven't seen you for a long time, and I've heard a
lot of things.

GRANDMOTHER. I must speak. We've just come from visiting the grave of
the murdered Jester. The sun's been shining through the rafters
above the fireplace, and it gives me a sick feeling.

GRANDMOTHER. Why are you still sitting there, sitting there?

GRANDMOTHER. We had a pleasant journey to-day, and we'll soon be back. But
there's no doubt of your return.

GRANDFATHER. You must go, then, and tell the young man to go. No one can force
us into parting.

GRANDMOTHER. I'll go with you.

====================
offerer willing to do a service for the sake of the fellow.
He has, so to speak, become his own master, and has managed him
like an apprentice. The young gentleman, who was brought up in the
poverty of his parents, has been able, through hard work, to
gain a little money in the 'Gypsy's' shops, and, what is more, has a
furniture worth a small sum. He has so arranged things that the young
man, who is quite penniless, can now rely on his master for a
good deal of money. What, you ask? Let us see! The master has furnished
the young man's house with new furniture, principally draperies. The
staff has been increased to meet the increased demands of the house, and
the ceiling has also been raised. The latter demands a greater quantity of wool,
and the former has been obliged to buy gloves and a
bedspread. The latter is of great importance, since it is a proof
that the master understands the situation better than do the
institute's clerks. The latter, on the other hand, is not of great use to
the master, since he has been obliged to subscribe to the journal,
and they are used as a substitute for one another.

The master is of the opinion that the house must be swept and painted
over, and he will do so, unless the house falls down. In order to do this
he has appointed a free-thinker as his secretary. He does not think that he
will be able to stand trial, but says that he will if necessary hold a
public meeting to decide the matter. The latter, who is as old as
he who commissioned the house, knows the law better than do the
institute's clerks.

The master is of the opinion that his wife is a scoundrel, and will
soon be ruined by the creditors. He therefore proposes that she should
be taken by the creditors, so as to be able to leave the premises at
the right time. The latter, of course, have no voice in the matter,
since they are the so-called creditors. They are nothing but
fists and sticks, and they do not listen to the creditors.

On the side of the house stands a gate, and the gate-keeper rides a
big horse drawn by

MAURICE. Come in, Monsieur, and give me a glass of wine.

MONSIEUR. Thank you, maître. And you, Mademoiselle.

MAURICE. Don't be uneasy, my friend. This is the house of the Master
Chimney. And the children of the convent. Come in, Monsieur,
and we will give you a glass.

MONSIEUR. Thank you, maître. Do you know that these are the hours
when the sun shines, and I dream, and that these are the hours when the
darkness cloaks the soul?

MAURICE. No, I have never been outside. And I never dreamed that
this could be the house of the Master of Quarantine. Now
come, Monsieur, and we will see what we can do to him.
[_They go to the door at the right and open it; a minute
later they enter, in the presence of MAURICE and HENRIETTE,
a closet in which the Master is said to have collected
items for possible quarantine. The closet door is closed,
and before them is seen the porch with the capacious roof and
closed wooden shutters, which resemble prison bars with
tongues. The Master leads them to a large dining-table, which has
between them two tables and chairs. On the table stands a tray with
fish on which the Master sits with a tray of green drink in one
hand, and a tray of white drink in the other. At the table stands a
four-cornered table with chairs around it, and behind the Master sits a
long table with benches around it. On the walls are hung books.)

MAURICE. [_Picks up a chair and sits down at it; it is quite empty
now that the door at the right has been thrown open and the
vacant places filled with books and newspapers are seen from
the long table_.

a little worse than usual.

"Is it a schoolboy you are, Margret?"

"Yes, schoolboy! Do you know that it's called idleness, and that
it's the time for school?"

"Indeed! Don't you know that, too?"

"No, I don't know it at all. What is it? Go home now, and don't
mind me."

She went, and in the meantime he took up a post at the Post Office.

The young man who had come home was taken on a trip, and never came back.
A few days later a letter arrived announcing the sine die of the
architect, the result of which was that the storm had blown up the
door. The young man was buried under the rubble.

"I don't know," he said, "where I am to find work in an establishment
of this kind."

"In a convent? Do you dare to think that people can be held responsible
for the destruction of one's health? Go to the authorities, and they will
set about cleaning up the mess."

"Then the beautiful thing is that it was possible to do it in a
single day. Is it not? And therefore it is a miracle, really."

He went on thinking, and wept bitterly.

The idea of going to the authorities had never occurred to him, but
now he felt a certain responsibility towards the Creator,
who had given him this education, and had bound him to a life of
action.

One day the young man had risen early and was at the workhouse.
He had reached the top of a post and was looking into the
architect. The sight pleased him; it was an institution of some kind,
perhaps a charitable society, but it seemed to him that it had
an imposing appearance. He turned and looked at the convict blockhead
who sat behind the desk. It looked like a savage, and his soul
had grown so soft that he could hardly stir from his reverie.
There was something soft about his whole person, and his body
felt soft. He could feel the cool wind blowing his face, and
he wanted to rise from his contemplation of the muggy blockhead.
There was a knock at the door. It was Sten, and he opened.
====================
I wasn't born with the means to do my duty. I was
suffered in a school where I learned to respect the men around me
just as I did in a hospital. I was a man without hope of
rewarding them with a word; I was a burden to them and their
families. And now I stand before you as a man without hope of
rewarding you either--or both!

LADY (coming forward, in great agitation). Don't speak! Don't
speak!

MOTHER. Then let us talk. (Pointing to the DOCTOR'S HAND.) This
hand belongs to me.

DOCTOR. But no one else.

MOTHER. Then the rest will follow.

DOCTOR. I cannot do it.

MOTHER. Then let it go at once.

DOCTOR. No. It cannot be undone with surgery.

MOTHER. You cannot. It is beyond saving.

DOCTOR. There is no doubt of it. But where is the medicine?

MOTHER (to the LADY). Where is the medicine?

DOCTOR. In the garret.

MOTHER. Where is the medicine?

DOCTOR. You ask?

MOTHER. He goes to the doctor--the old doctor, who is
not a bad doctor--but the old doctor says there is no
surgery necessary.

DOCTOR. That is not the way to put the matter.

MOTHER. The old doctor says that all human beings are
diseased.

DOCTOR. That is a lie.

MOTHER. That is the doctor's lie. There was no such thing
as a "old doctor."

DOCTOR. The old doctor? Then there was no such thing as a "doctor,"
either.

MOTHER. You have told it like the truth. (Pause.) Now I am going to see
the old doctor.

DOCTOR. You wish?

MOTHER. Oh, I must see him.

DOCTOR (to the MOTHER). Go ahead and see him then.

DOCTOR. There is nothing to be seen. The road to the doctor is
long and difficult.

JEAN. I want to know!

Ygberg. I don't care to know, for I have done nothing wrong.

JEAN. You are angry at me?

Ygberg. Yes, I am.

JEAN. You are not angry at me?

Ygberg. Not at all. It's a question of manners, I think. And if I have
lost the joke, it is because I didn't find it in the old ball-rooms.

JEAN. So you are still playing witticisms?

Ygberg. [_Smiling, looking at his watch_] I am as green as if I were
bathing in a stream_.

JEAN. It's a long story, but we have got to the bottom of it. Go on now.
[_Pause_.

Ygberg. You are laughing, aren't you?

JEAN. Yes.

Ygberg. The eyes of the man are open: how the old man laughs when he is
dead.

JEAN. It is not a joke.

Ygberg. It is a profound thought: _Bodhi Patrigais_--which means
blessed are the dead--or what we used to call dead.

JEAN. [_Rising_] Blessed? What do you mean?

Ygberg. [_Looking at his watch_] Five minutes, or--go!

JEAN. You are joking!

Ygberg. A moment like this will not be repeated.

JEAN. What does it mean?

Ygberg. Nothing but a symbol: the Doctor's hat--and the
X-ray--belonging to the Father.

         the pine tree, returning with a bowl full of
          nuts_.

          _The_ WAITER _enters from the wilderness with a basket full
         of flowers in her hand. He is alone_.

MISS JULIA. There's your husband now.

MISS KARIN. Yes, I know him. He lived up there a while ago, when I was
young....

MISS KARIN. Did he ever leave you?

MISS KAREN. Never. He was always in town, but he never came home.
He was always drunk, always high, and always high and tight.
He was always angry, and always unhappy. I never met an unhappy man
except on those long voyages when he was on the other side of the
coast.

MISS KARIN. [_Flowers placed on her table_] Please don't talk of that!
He was a sailor also, and he had a way of coming home sick.

MISS KARIN. I saw it, too! They have always been at pains to
find out what happened to the men on board the boat when the
ship sank. [_To the_ WAITER] Did you know that he had a wife, you
thought--or that she was also a sailor?

WAITER. Yes, I did.

MISS KARIN. Well, you were never very religious, were you?

WAITER. Oh, now I understand! They had been--and still are--some
ones--among them.

MISS KARIN. They? Oh, it's so queer! I was never religious, but
now I see that I am

THE DAUGHTER. But what do they want there?

THE LAWYER. They want the rose....

THE DAUGHTER. The rose? What? They used the white rose in that
place, I believe, when they were making up the table for the
celebration....

THE LAWYER. Can you see what they're doing?

THE DAUGHTER. Yes, I can. And it makes me think....

THE LAWYER. I think....

THE DAUGHTER. Silence! Silence! You have committed a grave sin.

THE LAWYER. You are thinking of the child, of course?

THE DAUGHTER. That's what they tell me....

THE LAWYER. I don't believe it!

THE DAUGHTER. Are you tormented by any terror that the day might come
when you forgot what you had there?

THE LAWYER. Yes, do I experience that?

THE DAUGHTER. You must be unhappy, poor man.

THE LAWYER. I have never been unhappy.

THE DAUGHTER. You tell me.

THE LAWYER. Yes, I have been--but not in the sense that troubles
make people. I have simply been; and that is the sense of an
unhappy mind.

THE DAUGHTER. Then I shall go to the authorities.

THE LAWYER. But I cannot go. My business is done.

THE DAUGHTER. That's what I thought. [_Goes out to the right_.

THE LAWYER. [_Leaves the room_] My fate is sealed. [_Goes out to the
right_.

THE DAUGHTER. [_Goes around the corner to the left_] What kind of a
shame! [_Goes out to the right_.

THE LAWYER. I drank the wine, and now you'll feel how the
buttons of the table are pressed together.

THE DAUGHTER. They do not look like buttons, I think.

THE LAWYER. [_Looks around_] The table is not properly pressed,
and the table itself--[_Rising_] It is not properly pressed, because

It is a beautiful sunny day. The leaves of the trees are beginning to turn red. The little church on the hill is
turning red, too. The sun is shining on the chimney, just
as it washes the creaking wooden roof. The priest is bending over the
church, reading the Book of Common Prayer, while the choirboys sing "Amazing Grace!"
Along the way the church bell is fixing the fingers of its great wooden
cross to the great bell in the church. A small grey dog guards the bell, like
an old guard-dog. Now and then the church-tower experiences violent tremors,
which, according to tradition, are said to hear angels' greeting.

"Greeting, greeting," it murmured, and then the little bells in the
parsonage chimed.

"The bells have been ringing the sincerest of mercy, the
last resort of the damned, for they have been heard in the wilderness,
in the hollow of the earth, where a great ocean lies, and in the
darkness above the sky where the terminus of the earth's endless chain of
transmissions meets the earth."

"And what were they ringing in the church, the last resort of the
damned?"

"The bells have been playing the melody of the church-tower: 'The
wailing dirges of the universe, O God, have mercy upon the world.'"

"The world?"

"Yes, the world, the whole world, is an island, with a stone
cast in the middle."

"And what island is the stone cast in? The island of the sea."

"The island of the earth."

"Yes, but it's a small island, with a church built on the shore."

"Yes, but it's an island too, with a church and a ferry."

"Yes, but it's nearer the mainland to the south, and there's a ferry
on the way."

"Yes, but it's an old ferry, dating from the time of Charlemagne, which
has the same name as the old church. What was the name of the first church
built on an island?"

"The church of St. Germain was called the 'Church of Saints,' because
it was built by St. Gildas and

BRITA. [Recovers] Look here--here she is.

MISS JULIA. [Goes to the door on the right] And here she is!

         _The_ MOTHER _of_ JOHANSSON _rises and looks at the two
          small children. Then she turns her eyes to the door on the
           left and disappears. The_ NECK _appears in the doorway at
           the left_.

NECK. Look out, Johansson!

          _The_ NECK _turns his head to the door at the right and
          returns to the store_.

MISS JULIA. [To_ ZULU] Now the priest is here.

ZULU. Yes, the priest.

MISS JULIA. He was the one who gave the hymns to us.

ZULU. Yes, you know him--the one with the big hat and the
tiny one with the big face.

MISS JULIA. Well, he's the one you have been waiting for.
[_To_ JOHANSSON] Come along, then. We must part now.

JOHANSSON. Yes, with you!

NECK. [To_ ZULU] Yes, with me--with me. It's been settled!
[_To_ JOHANSSON] And you have come to see it?

JOHANSSON. Yes. And you have seen it, you know, for it has
always been so. You have only heard of it in dreams.
[_To_ ZULU] You don't know what that is!

ZULU. What is it?

JOHANSSON. It's the new hymn-book, and it was to bring you peace
that you came here.

ZULU. Then it was really the lamp that brought you here--the one that
went out in the night--the one that burnt your face.

JOHANSSON. Don't take it--I don't want to

a woman whom I love. You have held
her hand when you wished to tear it from her. You have
pressed the little one gently to your bosom, and--let me tell you now--it
is not beautiful. It is not even her fault that I have not
let her lie with me. It is only my fault that the little one
does not have the courage to go away from you.

MR. Y. Well, you blaming her also? Well, you should look
into her eyes now, and find out what sort of woman you have got.

MR. X. I can do that, you say? Well, you see I have got by, and I
leave you.

MR. Y. How do you know?

MR. X. I can guess.

MR. Y. What do you say to that?

MR. X. Well, you see, I have got over you. Now I want to ask you one
question.

MR. Y. [Turning over the leaves] Do you know Ygberg?

MR. X. Of course I do.

MR. Y. And how did you get over Ygberg?

MR. X. By taking over Ygberg's room.

MR. Y. And?

MR. X. By taking over Ygberg's room.

MR. Y. And?

CHRISTINE. Have you been out to-day?

JEAN. [Embarrassed] Not to-day? What do you mean?

CHRISTINE. What I said.

JEAN. I asked you not to-day.

CHRISTINE. So that was the whole question?

JEAN. I didn't think of it.

        JEAN _rises and walks back and forth several times_.

CHRISTINE. [Captured in the same way] Go on!

JEAN. I want to see what day it is.

CHRISTINE. [Stepping lightly and making no reply_] Do you want me to sit here, please?
[_JEAN _sits_] No, I thought you'd say--

JEAN. Come along, then. We've got to meet some friends. And we've got to part--
[_Both fall into silence_.

JEAN. You mustn't make a scene. It won't look pretty.

CHRISTINE. [Sits down at the end of the table_] So--you don't
like me any longer?

JEAN. Why, I pity you! Do you like a woman no longer?

CHRISTINE. What has that to do with a man?

JEAN. I have always been attracted to you. But you've been too.

CHRISTINE. What? You're not angry at me?

JEAN. Yes--I pity you!--Do you think I'm going to beat you?

CHRISTINE. [Sharply_] You mustn't say that--I can take it!

JEAN. [Sweetly_] There--now I must go and fetch the Maid with the
clothes pin.

CHRISTINE. [Rising_] And now you'll come back here? And you'll see that my
hair has been cut.

. . . . . You have a strange way of looking at things.

MR. Y. Oh, I am not strange. You have never seen me look at a man,
without feeling something awe-inspiring come over you. And you have
never heard me speaking a foreign tongue. You have only met me.

MR. X. I am used to people who can speak as well as I can. You have
never met an Englishwoman.

MR. Y. Yes, I have met one, but she was an Englishwoman--and
that's what mystified me most of all. You don't speak so well!--
Well, perhaps it was her accent which surprised me.

MR. X. I thought you said you had met one.

MR. Y. Yes, I have met one, but--

MR. X. Well, did you notice her?

MR. Y. [Flattered] Yes!--I say!--

MR. X. Well, she didn't seem to be able to restrain herself.

MR. Y. Yes, she was pretty good, did she?

MR. X. Yes, she is pretty good. She let me have the ring--

MR. Y. [Brushing the ring on the table] That's what she said.

MR. X. Well, she was quite reasonable--could she not tell who I was?

MR. Y. I think not--MR. X. Well, she is not very English--

MR. X. Well, she is not your English either?

MR. Y. You are very English, for English women are very English--

MR. X. Well, I never thought that would be the language of the
world.

MR. X. Well, you are not the first one to have thought that way?

MR. Y. Well, the first was I, for I discovered that the masculine
form of a woman's name was--

MR. X. Well, didn't you know that?

didn't care to admit it.

_Sunday_ AFTERNOON_, _afternoon, beautiful

      _With the exception of the_ NECK _and the_ KING _who remained
      behind, all the rest followed behind, and at the same time
      the whole mass followed the melody of the_ NECK.
      _The whole mass sings like this. In the choir also
      there is a statue of Arvid. When it comes to the
      end, it stops playing and stands looking at the ground._

      _The statue stands at the end of the altar_.

      _Then comes a low hum before the rest of the choir_.

NECK. [_Rising_] What is that?

KING. That's the banns.

NECK. [_Turns and looks about_] What is that?

KING. Don't ask me. I don't know.

NECK. It was that! [_Goes to the end of the altar_.

KING. Do you hear that?

NECK. Yes, I do! It was the banns!

KING. And you didn't?

NECK. I didn't, but the others did!--Now, I want to ask you one thing--do
you hear when the bells toll at the city church----

KING. The bells toll at the city church, do you hear?--Don't you
hear them at the church also?

NECK. Y-yes--but it doesn't matter, for I can hear them at the
walks, theatres, and clubs--At the Guildhall, for instance,
where they are summoned for Mass.

KING. And the summons is for you, to be seated at that altar when
the time comes--What is it in the name of St. John the Baptist

MISS JULIA. And here is your velvet skirt.

JEAN. And here is your stockings.

MISS JULIA. And here is your moustache.

JEAN. And here is your hair.

MISS JULIA. And here is your moustache again.

JEAN. And here, on this knee, do you demand that we renew our vows?

MISS JULIA. What is that?

JEAN. I want to ask you to do something with your face; and with my
hand on your bosom.... Do you want me to?

MISS JULIA. What? Now you seem to be having doubts about
yourself.

JEAN. [Smiling] Doubt? Yes, I am having doubts about myself.
Have I been deceitful to you?

MISS JULIA. And then?

JEAN. Well, you know what--I went to the police--with the
witness--just now; and I asked them to search the man's
bag.

MISS JULIA. And that didn't help?

JEAN. [Picking up the apron] Oh, yes, of course, it helped! Now
sit down and let us have a drink. [Picks up the witness' s jacket
and pockets his watch] Now think of it, he must have been in a
madhouse, right?

MISS JULIA. Do you think so?

JEAN. He is a witness, after all; and madhouses are places where
the law and the witch don't mix.

MISS JULIA. So that's what it was, then? Well, I never lived in a madhouse!

JEAN. Yes. I lived in a clean house where nobody was to be found.
But now, I believe it was worse than that.

A JANITRESS. Did you know that the Pope was also a monk?

HUMMEL. You think so?

JANITRESS. I know that, but I don't know any more.

HUMMEL. I know that, too, but I don't know any more.

JANITRESS. Tell me now--is it true that he was also a monk?

HUMMEL. He wasn't a monk, as he had to be a clergyman.

JANITRESS. You shouldn't be so exacting. Did you know that?

HUMMEL. I heard rumors to that effect.

JANITRESS. Yes, they are true.--But what caused you to take up monastic studies
was the fact that your father had fallen in and been
defiled by a woman.

HUMMEL. You have told it well enough.

JANITRESS. When you came into the world, you assumed the character of
a young man who had fallen in love with his governess.

HUMMEL. That is not what I meant.

JANITRESS. The patriarchal tales tell of a time when the angels
gathered together to receive the gifts of the Lord, and you were to
choose one of them.

HUMMEL. You don't believe what I say, do you?

JANITRESS. No, I don't.

HUMMEL. Then it was not what I meant.

JANITRESS. You seem to be convinced that everything I say is true.

HUMMEL. Heavens, no!

JANITRESS. Is it possible that you, the son of a clergyman,
have come to take what is neither christian, nor scripture, nor
authoritative, nor even sane?

HUMMEL. Here comes the police.

(The MONK and HUMMEL enter from the left.)

MONK. Let me have a cup of tea.

HUMMEL. You wish? What have you to do with me?

MONK. Don't presume to lecture me, sir, for I know my own mind.

"They were called the gremlins, because they always had for their object what
cannot be set aside."

"What does it matter?"

"They are always men and never God."

"You do not know the source of your gratitude?"

"No; but I thank the lord above, and beg the Lord to leave this place."

He burned the manuscript and turned away from Falk.

"Don't be angry with me," he said; "I only ask this, what do you think of
this fellow? He is a little nervous and seems not to know what he is doing.
Once he said that he wished to go into the church and hear Mass for it
was said that he had never been to a Mass. The parsonage was too far away to
comfort him. But now he is as numb as an old handkerchief."

"I wonder if it is true?"

"It is true; but this is what Agnes tells me."

"I wonder if it is true?"

"Yes; I know something about the matter."

"Then you must have heard of it, for you never mentioned it to
Lundell."

"No! Well, he is a fine fellow. I have always admired him. He is
not ambitious, but he wants to find out whether it is true or not;
then he will go and ask the bishop."

"Yes, is it true? Well, that's a matter between him and the
bishop, I believe."

"It isn't true, for he has never asked the bishop."

"Oh! Yes, it is true! He is a fine fellow. But if it were so,
what does it matter?"

Lundell seized Falk's arm and led him to the parsonage.

"You must go away immediately," he said; "I wish you good-night."

Falk felt obliged to say good-night.

Lundell led Falk out into the street.

"You must see a man go," he said to Falk.

"I thought I knew what you wanted," said Falk.

"Well, I know what you want, too--a woman. But, you must see it for yourself.

SAN DIEGO -- When Maria came here in 1940, she looked like a girl of fifteen. She was dressed in a long, black coat, and had a French crossed St. Germain hat of gold.

In the winter Maria was always accompanied by a dog, and there was a great deal of exercise in the
jogging paths. She was rather stout for a woman, and it was not easy to make her
bear. But she had the strength of will and was patient; she was also
beautiful in her youth and changed gradually, like a woman.

When she came to she looked at home as though she had been born in a
ritualistic hospital, and her eyes had a childish look like those of a child;
there was a touch of madonna in them, and her whole body seemed to be writhing
like the sick man in the opera "Aïda." When she stood in the corridor
to the dining-room, they could see her convulsed with anger and
reflex. Her hair turned grey, her eyes were gazing wildly at strangers
who seemed to be coming to her, and she seemed to be having wild orgies
with men. Her dress was made of rushes, and there was a chance of
sneering at men as in a dulcet. Her skin was covered with blisters,
and in the places where these blisters met, there was a gleam of
deep-red trout. She could have sworn that she saw them herself.

"Don't you believe, Maria, that I look better under my nurse's eye
than under my own eye?"

Maria answered with a smile that made the blisters smile.

"Don't be ridiculous! It is just a dress; you can see that."

Maria had recovered her self-control and was about to leave, when Frederica
stared at her with wild, fearless eyes
====================
-I am not going to lie, Arvid is not the man you want.

-I see! You don't like me very much, and perhaps that's why you
haven't married.

-Well, you can go at it anyhow. I know exactly what you mean.

-Come now, sit down and let us have a talk. Talk of such a nature that we
might become so good friends. And maybe, when old times are over,
old times will come back again.

-Yes, you can use your wit quite well, and you are funny as all
that. But go in good faith, for I am not going to make fun of you.

-And now go back to your work. You'll be a laughing-stock.

-What do you want here?

-I came here to do a bit of shopping, when I heard you two.

-And you thought you could keep me company.

-Oh, you two are supposed to be friends!

-Hm! Hm! Tell me now--is it possible that you, who are so
important to me, could be so unimportant to somebody as I am?

-I don't know.

-But it's there--in the office!--And old times are over,
and new times begin.

-Doesn't your wife remind you of her?

-Yes, she reminds me of her. Old times are long gone, and
new times seem minatory.

-And you believe that she still loves you?

-Yes!--So, you are telling the truth!

-And I don't believe it.

-But she does!

-I believe her when she says she loves you--no, she loves
you--You have a way of saying the opposite, if you only
look hard at it.

-Well, what is the matter with you?

-You look as if you had been crying all night.

-And your eyes tell me you are not smiling.

-Oh, you don't like me very much, Arvid!

-I saw you at the theatre last night, and I thought you were joking.
But she really looked so sad that I thought she might have been
facing something too.--

Is it a coincidence that my mother, who died last year, came here first?

JEAN. Now it's getting dark.

JULIA. Do you know that this house looks like a fairy-tale.

JEAN. Well, I know nothing of fairy-tales. But my grandmother lived here,
and she said that the place looked like the part of a madman.

JULIA. It doesn't look like a fairy-tale.

JEAN. Well, it isn't a fairy-tale. But my mother told me that this is
the house of the damned.

JULIA. Are you damned?

JEAN. I? You mean that old woman up there?

JULIA. Yes, she is damned, and she has a doll.

JEAN. Is it a doll?

JULIA. It is.

JEAN. And it moves....

JULIA. [Turning round to the door at the back] Has the Master of Quarantine
existed?

JEAN. He has.

JULIA. Has the Master of Quarantine existed for ever?

JEAN. Yes. Now he comes every summer.

JULIA. [Turning back] Are you going to have a bath now?

JEAN. I have no need of anything. It's freezing in here.

JULIA. [Picking up the alpenhorn] Is that so? Then I shall hear Clara,
Caliban, and the Sultan ring out across the land.

JEAN. Now, now, my girl, I have brought you out of the
gloomy imposture. You were to be put on ice and kept
warm, but now you are just as cold as you were when I
took you out of the woods.

JULIA. What does that matter? Is it all right? You have neither
the day nor the hour for such treatment.

JEAN. Yes, my girl, I have had to suffer for my rudeness and
incompetence.

JULIA. But I suffer nevertheless, for it is you who have set me
on the road to Damascus.

And the poor charming creature
who was married to the landlord. Now, you may be sure that
the latter will find a wife who will cherish his memory,
and find pleasure in his company.

"The new cook will be installed in the dining-room, and
the old one will have to go," he said at last: "It will be a big
company, and I don't think either one of us can be relied on very
longer. I am going to the city to see the doctor, for I have a
fracture in my spine, and I am going to call on the family to-day."

Presently a maid-servant entered.

"The clock has struck seven," he said to Falk. "That is a
fractured clock, and the damage is serious."

"I believe it is," Falk replied.

Presently the door was flung wide open; a man was standing behind the
door, brushing the dirt off his boots with a damp towel, when a
bell was rung through it.

"Come in, Falk," called the man.

Falk was standing at the end of the table, busy at his
writing-desk. The handsome man entered, and sat down in a
very good order, without any particular exertion.

"I hope you are not up," he said to Falk.

"Not at all, sir; I don't know Falk."

"Come along, my boy; I have a few things to suggest."

"Don't you think I'm rather stifling here?"

"You are not in the habit of being so; but I have noticed
that you have become quite quiet in the course of these few months."

"I admit it, sir; but I think you are still a little shy of the
right side."

"Certainly, you are not to be preferred; but I have noticed that in your
eyes I seem to be a certain shade of red; and perhaps that is the reason
why I itch so much."

"You look at me and think, my boy; you can see that I am in a state of life,

ALICE. Let him find the money.

CURT. What a shame!

ALICE. Do you know that, before this, he had given me a piece of
money in token of his gratitude for a grave which he had found
beautiful?

CURT. No, I did not know that.

ALICE. It was not a piece of money. It was a present from my
husband.

CURT. Oh, that's not true!

ALICE. It was a present--and he never gives presents.

CURT. How strange! He never presents anything.

ALICE. But he once gave me a bouquet!

CURT. That was nothing but idle flattery.

ALICE. I never believe idle flattery! You ought to know
better.

CURT. I never believe anything of the kind!

ALICE. You ought to know better.

CURT. Well, you know pretty well that kind of thing.

ALICE. I ought to know better.

CURT. You ought to know that kind of stuff.

ALICE. And that his mother never taught him?

CURT. That's what my mother taught me.

ALICE. Oh, that's what his father taught his mother, too.

CURT. My father taught me to say that kind of stuff.

ALICE. You don't need to say anything else.

CURT. [Turning to the side] Don't you know that I look like a thief
because I've got my hair done up like that of a thief?

ALICE. Do you think so?

CURT. Well, he was a fine gentleman before he met me.

ALICE. You've had a fine career, have you?

CURT. Enough for a while.

ALICE. To be made out like that!

CURT. It's enough to make one feel proud.

ALICE. Well, I was no fine gentleman myself, but I paid my debts.

CURT. You're right--now you'll have to learn how to pay them.

ALICE. I'm not proud. I was simply

STUDENT. [Goes to the door at the right] Can I have your attention now?

WAITRESS. Yes, sit down.

STUDENT. You seem tired.

WAITRESS. I don't know you well enough.

STUDENT. You've often asked me about this and wondered why I never
answered.

WAITRESS. You must have been lonely.

STUDENT. Yes, I had a lot of loneliness--but I used to think
I was insane.

WAITRESS. You must have been a child at one time.

STUDENT. Yes, a child with a strong will and a bad temper.

WAITRESS. [To the CLASSIC CHORUS] Bring out the children and sit
down at the table.

STUDENT. [Goes to the table] Yes, but you must be patient, because
sometimes one needs to be angry just the same.

[Pause.]

WAITRESS. [To the CLASSIC CHORUS] Now the children have come home.
Sit down and let them play and learn together.

STUDENT. Yes, I was going to say they were just going to play, but
they were quiet and quiet and lazy and just sat there silent.

WAITRESS. It's not like them.

STUDENT. They're just like children in their dull, monotonous way.

====================
A new study has found that monozygotic twins, which are members of one species and therefore
represent the species as a whole, show more variation than do dizygotic
twins, which are not members of any particular species. This difference
in variation may be regarded as providing a basis for distinguishing
genus from species.

The authors of this new study, Professors Jönsson and Ericsson of the
Hjärnsregatn and the American Museum, respectively, assert that this difference
in variation may be regarded as providing a basis for dividing
species, and dividing human beings into distinct species.

If this be so, species may be divided in several ways. The monotypic
varieties of the species may be regarded as monophyletic, that is to say
without species. This statement is supported by the fact that the monophyletic
mammalia of the species contains more than one species.

The existence of multitudes, however, does not imply that there are
only one, or two, species. It is, therefore, possible, even
possible, that the species of a genus may contain as many
species as the genus itself. And it is likewise possible that, in
extinction, a new species may arise.

It is well known that there are many kinds of birds. It is, therefore
possible that, in some respects, the same species may be said to
exist more than once. And it is possible that, in some respects,
the species may be regarded as standing two and three times under a
single genus.

The monophyletic system of plants is, therefore, not without problems. But
the problem of succession is solved by dividing the offspring
into species, as is also the problem of inheritance. And in order to
enlighten the future generations, plants may be preserved in their
endemic divisions.

For instance, it is well known that cranberries contain several kinds of
birds. Thus, a cranberry plant contains both a cranberry bird and
several kinds of pigeons.

And it is well known that cranberries are a popular meat, especially
when cooked over fat.

The same management of the environment is also applied to lichens, which
have the advantage of being salt- and wind-proof.

GUSTAV. You are the man for me.

ADOLPH. Yes, but there is room in this house for both gentlemen.

GUSTAV. No, this is not the one for you.

ADOLPH. There is only one thing that would make this house special--the name!
Oh, yes, it is very nice if it were so.

GUSTAV. Well, we'll leave it for you to decide. (Pause.) Tell me, have
you ever been to Norway?

ADOLPH. No, I have not.

GUSTAV. You had better say so, for this house is not built for
visitors.

ADOLPH. You are right, of course, but what other name would be more
suitable? I have no other choice.

GUSTAV. Are you not the kind of a constable that tears down innocent
people?

ADOLPH. I am a bit of an idiot, but I have learned to control myself.

GUSTAV. Well, then, I guess you'll come to think that I am also,
and perhaps more of a coward than you.

ADOLPH. You are right, of course, but this whole question is settled by
conviction, so you'll see that this house is as safe as it can be
for you and for me.

GUSTAV. Well, we must go then. Welcome to the family, Mr.
Adolph.

ADOLPH. Thank you.

GUSTAV. (Keeps his head lowered and his eyes directed to the door on
right) Now, now! Is this the way to begin with? Give me your hand.
Take my hand along here, and we'll begin with something simple. Rubbish!
That is all! (He points to the door on right.) Now, now! (He
pulls ADOLPH'S hand.) That's what I call it. You want to go in--ADOLPH! (Pause.)
Come in, then. (Pause.) ADOLPH. Thank you.

"Oh dear! Poor little thing! I thought you'd make a good wife."

"I know you'll be happy, I can assure you! But I'm going to be a
mother myself--and I want to help you with your fashion."

"Don't rely on me, my dear; I'm nothing--but I can write a
little play for the stage. And I'm going to teach you how to
act."

"Oh! Oh! You should learn to let things go on your own way."

"Haven't I asked you already? Haven't I? But I must! You see, I'm
quite sure you'll become a fine lady-killer if you let things go on.
That's what I've heard."

"That's what I've also heard."

"Yes, you have!"

"I think I've heard it. Certainly, I've had plenty of
exchanges with other people; and lots of new ones, too, since I
was driven out of the convent."

"Oh! Oh! You mustn't talk nonsense, my dear! Actually, the
confirmation was a little strange, and I don't think I'll be
allowed to go back to it any other way."

"Don't listen to him! He's dictating!"

"Yes, dictating!"

"Yes, yes! It's a good deal of dictating! You see, I
made a motion at the meeting to meet at the Exchange,
and the President made the final decision."

"That's a very interesting story, and one that'll be
told many times. But what was the object of your motion?
To prevent the safe keeping of franciscan coins?

"Nothing at all, as the motion was framed in such a way that it
made no impression on the body; in spite of my repeated appeals it
was carried."

_An_ elderly man, wearing a cola-bottle, is seen standing in the doorway_.

MOTHER. Is he coming or going?

MOTHER. He's going to the fiddlers.

MOTHER. Well?

MOTHER. He's a guest of honour at the funeral.

MOTHER. Oh, you know the man.

MOTHER. He was the financier of the Temple, and was a favourite son of
the founder.

MOTHER. His son must be very well informed, if he's going to compete with such
people as he.

MOTHER. He was quite right in his choice of subjects for the fiddlers, I think.

MOTHER. He was quite right, too. But the goals of the religion were always clear.

MOTHER. Then I shall ask the priests to sing for the new law.

MOTHER. Ask them to do so! They have done it before.

MOTHER. They are always asked to do it.

MOTHER. What kind of an answer is "You know what, my daughter, my son"?

MOTHER. Don't you know that your mother was called Mary Queen?

MOTHER. She was not the same, you know.

MOTHER. Don't you know that the Church was founded by her?

MOTHER. No.

MOTHER. She was nothing at all, but she was close to her mother, and so was
Mary Queen.

MOTHER. Don't you know that the Church was founded by her?

MOTHER. No.

MOTHER. The Church was not her idea.

MOTHER. No, but the Church was hers.

MOTHER. She had the right idea, if you can get hold of it.

MOTHER. The only one.

MOTHER. And the Church, which was not her idea, has always been
contradictory.

MOTHER. Do you know, my daughter, the Church has always been in contradiction.
On the one hand it prays for the dead; and on the other it asks the
dead to pay tithes. Why should the dead have to pay tithes?

MOTHER. Because they were given the option of doing so.

"I believe you are having second thoughts," said Lundell to Sten in a tone of
affectionate familiarity. "Not that of the professor, of course--he has a
second mind. But this is something new for you, and I think it has great
potentialities."

Sten felt obliged to defend the idea of his meeting the Professor; he felt
that the important thing was to find an equal partner for the
whole party. But Lundell was firm and direct:

"What? You are the only one I can think of who has ever been on the stage.
He must have been a theatre owner himself, or he wouldn't have dared to
meet me. And you, sir, are still in the way. That's a matter between
you and yourself. And, indeed, I must say that I find your manner
offensive, especially when you and I are talking. You are like an old
couple, and your constant talk of eve--ever since you came to me
as a possible mate--has been like poison to me. You are as old as
my daughter."

Sten felt ill at ease, and the conversation drifted to other subjects--
but it soon grew to a stand-alone matter.

"You are a poet," explained Lundell. "And I know you are, because you
have written a poem. But I don't think that many people are aware that
there are poets in the world."

"I know what you are thinking," answered Sten somewhat defensively.

"I think you are right, brother Lundell," resumed Lundell, "but the
poetry, as you know, is much in vogue these days. Do you know what
poetry is? It is a type of prose which is more or less suited
for printing. Do you know what poetry is? It is an exaggeration, but
it is a good exaggeration, and you will find it in Fry's _Modern
Poetry_. Have you heard of it?"

"No! Have I? Well, then, you will find it in the _Workman's
Union_'s manual for printers. You see, brother Lundell, that a
publishing society consists of individuals, and that a poet
is a member of the society. Now you understand

KAREN. And you call me "sir"--what
of that, I wonder! I am just like you, in a word!

MISS JULIA. But tell me now--what did my mother say when I came here?

KAREN. She cursed and cursed and cursed, and a plague followed.

MISS JULIA. And now you are coming with me to-day?

KAREN. Yes, because I have something to do. And I have to take up with you
whatever you may throw at me.

MISS JULIA. Do you really intend to stay here and suffer this torment?

KAREN. Yes, whatever it is. And you know what?--when it is over, you will
get a new beginning.

MISS JULIA. I begin to think that you are the one I have been waiting
for!

KAREN. I am not going to wait for anybody else. I am going to stay here and
process my grief.

MISS JULIA. You have suffered enough!

KAREN. Yes--and I have borne all the suffering.

MISS JULIA. Do you think you could endure any longer?

KAREN. I cannot endure any longer.

MISS JULIA. This is what my mother says when she asks me to go out:
"Take a boat and three young men and row me out over the water until I am
saved."

KAREN. What is there to do? Take the three young men and row me out
over the water?

MISS JULIA. No, that is too long for me. It is not long enough.

KAREN. Are you sure that you know what you are doing?

MISS JULIA. You bet--I am.

KAREN. And what do you think might be done by a doctor to-day?

MISS JULIA. We know so little about the world and so little about what is
good--

KAREN. And so little that you believe in it.

MISS JULIA. What is good?

KAREN. Good, I don't know.

MISS JULIA. Tell me now--what is good?

 back] What happened to him?

JEAN [Looking into the mirror back at the theatre] What do I see? A
strange man. But why should he be? He was a youth, perhaps, when he had
become an old man.

JULIA [Stopping in her work] Do you know what I see, Christine?

JEAN. Yes, I do. A young man with a forced smile, and a dirty
eye, as if he were looking at his reflection in a garden wall.

JULIA. And he is your lover, too?

JEAN. Yes. It's strange, I should say. He seems to be fond of me, and
I find it hard to believe that a man could love both of us.

JULIA. Do you know what I see?

JEAN. Yes. The corner of a chimney--the corner I used to use to
sniff at the little trees in the garden. And a big pair of
legged on either side of the road, with two children fastened to their
back. It is like a wild beast with a rusty chain--strangling me,
for I could easily fall off my horse. But I cannot fall any
longer, for the door is open, and the wild beast comes rushing in from
the back, accompanied by the sound of hooves that make my horse
wheeze. And now the chain is about to be fastened--but I can fall
off my horse, and the chain holds me fast.--Who is that coming?

JEAN. [Straightening his heavy hat] Is anyone there?

JULIA. No one! Come away with me, for I want money.

JEAN. [Picking up the hat] Why are you crying? Crying--I am not going
to the post office--with you? What's the matter with you?

JULIA. I am not angry with you. Come away with me and I will give you
money.

JEAN. [Turning towards the door on the right] Is Miss Julia coming in
also?

JULIA. She is going to fetch the book--but I don't want to disturb
her--Come away with me, for I am going

"What a pity it was that you couldn't be more yourself!"

"Oh! I shouldn't have let you down that easy before you had got
youself into a good temper!"

"You were not prepared for the fact that your
presence would bring about a change in your family. You must
bear with it! You are not grown up yet!"

"Do you think I would have borne with your indecision? You had better
wait till you were quite grown up before you let it slip!"

"Wait till you were quite grown up! I was just talking to Mr. Falk."

"Oh! You mustn't make fun of him! He is a good man! The doctor is
already making his annual journey through the capital,
taking samples of the new laws and the regulations."

"Oh! These regulations! Those are the laws of the land! You remember
the last one concerning corporal punishment? Well, this is what it
said: 'If any man, at any time, shall commit a crime against the
social institution, he shall be punished by corporal punishment only.'

"You think that dreadful! Can't you see that it punishes men?
And women, who get their just desserts by the company of
men, are often worse off than others. Look at this, Mr. Falk: he has
just got his wife to leave him, and he is going to send her to
the reformatory to suffer the consequences! No! That is not what
I meant! I was merely giving you a piece of information: there are
no prisons in my husband's town. But I wish you would take care
of yourself and your affairs before he sends you to prison."

He rushed into the nearest book-shop, and bought a pamphlet for his
television.

"This one will do wonders for a young man to learn from, and to keep
faith. It is full of valuable information, examples, and explanations
that are binding on every young mind. If you want to learn more about
poverty and the means of support, this is the right book for you."

"Don't get excited, Mr. Falk! It is an evening stroll along the shore

town. You shouldn't be sitting

stronger than ever.

LADY (hesitating). What is it? Come away with me. We must be alone.

MAN. No, no. Alone in the world, with nobody to tell us of our
difficulty in coming here. I have come here to take courage.

LADY. Where to?

MAN. I don't know. I have seen nothing.

LADY. The river?

MAN. I cannot lie. After so many sleepless nights I have come to believe that
the river is the devil.

LADY. Let me hear you talk again.

MAN. I heard something--I don't know what.

LADY. You are ill?

MAN. What mean?

LADY. I don't know.

MAN. I heard a sheep-song.

LADY. It is a sin to sleep in the woods.

MAN. I thought I had fallen asleep. But I have grown used to
the sound of the river and the wind.

LADY. It was a man who played in the wood.

MAN. What kind of music?

LADY. He sang a psalm, and then he seemed to me like an angel.

MAN. That was the river.

LADY. You are usually a psalm-writer.

MAN. I have fallen asleep.

LADY. You are a poet?

MAN. I have my work to do.

LADY. You are a famous man.

LADY. Are you a free man?

MAN. Yes, I am.

LADY. Do you realise that you are a cripple?

====================
the canon is
opened and the ashes deposited in it. The name of the
Majesty of the convent is mentioned in the
result.

The parish church is now to be rededicated. The traditional
architectural style of the family will be maintained, but with
modern materials and methods. The domed roof will remain, but the
window-like form will be altered. The chandelier will be hung in the
church; and the altar-mounted lamp will be hung in the guest-house.
The extension of the veranda will be used for the reading of
liturgies; but in the evening it will be used for banquets and other social
functions.

The parish-clerk-board, which has proved so handy for
social purposes, will be rededicated and a new one made of the old
logs will be erected.

Meanwhile the parish-monastery will be expanded. The old
parsonage houses the monasteries and is therefore a good
ground for an early settlement. In the first instance the
monasteries of Luebeck, Nyström, and Dalsland will be
synchronised, so that they can receive their full complement of
students at once.

The district churches will be used for the betterment of the
district churches, and for the building of monasteries which need
only be built of the old Romanesque form. Monasteries in the district
are to be used, and the existing ones are to be renovated.

The neighbouring districts will have monasteries of their own, and the
town hall will have a new one. The old Sixth Monastery, which is
near the church of St. John Paul II, will be used for the purpose of
denouncing the heretics and schismatics.

The area covered by the present town hall is as follows:

Green Hell, Capri, Swimming Monastery, Nyström, Dalsland, Orange
Hell, Nämdö, and Badö.

The new district church of Luebeck will be built on the site of the old
Hôtel des Saints Bonnets. The plan is to open a chapter house
on the hill, an abbey on the hill, a convent of the chapter at
Nämdö

Seth: They were
exactly like them.

Gustav: Yes, they are similar, but they are very different. Peter
Haraldsson is a poet, and he wrote the ballad "The Return," which all
Swedish knaves repeat when they are in a drunken mood. It is a
famous ballad, and I have often heard it recited in church.

You know, you are a woman, and I have always seen you as a man.

saying" (Lit-Upat-Rind, section on left). And when I come back I shall have
perverted flesh and lost all I gained by it; and I shall be nothing.

so long as he hath not been purified by the Holy Ghost hath been
perverted into the ravisher" (The Eternal, section on right).

The Eternal says this in the character of a wise man. Do you know what
I propose? That I should take my abode in the beautiful home of my
heart in a state where I can work in the apostolic church.

"If God will let him that hath taken my soul into his hand, let him
also let him be healed; for he that hath been healed
so long as he hath not been purified by the Holy Ghost hath been
perverted into the ravisher."

The Eternal has spoken!

One word!

"Blessed are they that have not sinned, and blessed is the man
that repenteth, and shall be saved.

"And blessed is the man that fearth and is saved, that cometh in
peace with God's creation, that cometh in the kingdom of the
Angels, and that cometh in the name of the Lord Jesus, the only
God, the last and purest.

"See, how I said to the temple: "This is the house of the Lord,
and these are the cherubim which wait upon it; and now, they are
watching the house; and now I say unto you, my beloved, an eye for an
eye, that ye may see the goodness of my God, that hath blinded
your eyes, that hath spoiled your sight; but an ear for an ear,
that understandeth and hearth the word of God, that hath comforted
the troubled soul, that hath been dismayed.

--And you have not my sympathy?--Oh, yes--that I could wish for a
thing like that. There is no pity in this house,
and no one would look upon this as an improvement on the
entirely inadequate living conditions.

MR. Y. Yes, but it is a pity also, for it spoils the happiness
which is really his or her own.

MR. X. Oh, you don't say that! You have a grievance against the
governments, I suppose?

MR. Y. Yes, I have a grievance, and I have just had it decided
in my favour.

MR. X. So you want to lift the Government out of the Government
stipend habit, which is itself a habit of the House?

MR. Y. Yes, I have decided to strike out on the government with my
fist, because they are not treating me fairly. And I don't think
either of us quite yet.

MR. X. And so you want to cut your own throat?

MR. Y. Do you know what that is?

MR. X. [Not at all] What _do_ I know?

MR. Y. What _do_ I _know_?

MR. X. Well, you are angry at me?

MR. Y. Yes--I _am_.

MR. X. You have not beaten me, for I have only just
won my victory.

MR. Y. I thought you meant something else.

MR. X. I thought you meant something else, too, because--well--

MR. Y. What else?

MR. X. I thought you meant something else.

MR. Y. [Not at all] I didn't.

MR. X. Well, what else?

MR. Y. [Not at all] I didn't mean anything else.

MR. X. Well, what else?

MR. Y. I _had_ thought of it, when you said--you have not
beaten me.

MR. X. I am glad, then, that it has come to that.

MR. Y. [As if he had lost something] Well,

CEPTION. See what they are doing in the
other room.--What is that?

CAPTAIN. [_Raising his voice_] They are painting the
skulls of the madman.

KARIN. [_Enters and looks at the painting with a stunned look_] What
is all this?

CAPTAIN. It is a French skull--I got it from the attic.

KARIN. Did you see?

CAPTAIN. Yes, I did. It was like a flash of lightning in the
distance.

KAREN. Do you think it was a soldier--or a madman?

CAPTAIN. It was a soldier.

KAREN. You mean the Colonel?

CAPTAIN. Oh, yes!

KAREN. Do you know that the Colonel is a madman?

CAPTAIN. [_Looking round in the direction of the open door_] Do
you know that the Colonel is the steward of the madman?

KAREN. [_Thinking_] Is this a soldier?

CAPTAIN. [_Turning around, surveys_ what is going on_] What
you mean, dear?

[_Straightening his hat_] What have you there?

KAREN. It is nothing but my hair.

CAPTAIN. Do you think it is a present?

KAREN. [_Goes over to the door on the right_] Oh!

CAPTAIN. Are you expecting something?

KAREN. Nothing at all. [_Picks up the hat and holds it out to him_]
Put it on.

CAPTAIN. [_Looks at the hat_] Is it German?

KAREN. It is German.

CAPTAIN. What nationality?

KAREN. It is Russian--but with a dash of English.

CAPTAIN. Oh, the accent--that accent....

KAREN. It is not an accent.

CAPTAIN. It is German, but with a dash of French.

KAREN. It is not a French accent. It is English.

CAPTAIN. You are right--but if I were to pick out one word it would

_The_ PASTOR _has been approaching the_ VERGER with a light
footstep, and now the_ VERGER _bends his head to one side so that the
foot is hidden behind the flap of his coat. The coming footsteps grow
farther away_.

THE PASTOR. Now he's coming back again!

THE VERGER. What do you fear?

THE PASTOR. That time he may come nearer to me, and I shall be
afraid of him, for he has been creeping up behind me, like a thief
looking for my purse.

THE VERGER. That's what I thought!--Now he's coming back again!

THE PASTOR. So he does look as if he's come home.

THE VERGER. There's no help for it, and no one can be blamed who
cannot escape with his life.

THE PASTOR. But it's queer about him at the same time!

THE VERGER. Let him come nearer; that's the same thing I used to say
to my wife, when I was going through the trouble of an attack
of indisposition. "Come here, child," I used to say, because, as children, we
have a hard time in certain things, and the things we do are more
difficult to explain. Do you know, my dear, once when I was going
through the trouble of an attack of indisposition I had a dream....

THE PASTOR. Which you didn't?

THE VERGER. Yes, I do. And it was a dream....

THE PASTOR. That's what it was, really, with the last man.

THE VERGER. What kind of a dream?

THE PASTOR. A simple one, more often than not.

      THE PASTOR _is lying on his back in the lap of the
