@manolo_jiujitsu No I’m giving MexiCan/America’s the dream that hard work pays off. By obeying the laws. I had to do it. I change my life by obeying laws. That why where I am in my life. Obey the laws of our great country.
@CptBozoJabroni No because I would do any thing to stay with them. Not abandon them. Don’t let the media brainwash you.
@dazzaDS Yes look a history.

Tito Ortiz discusses decision to continue fighting under Combate Americas, details call to Randy Couture that played ‘huge’ factor  via @MMAFighting
@larryfishermac Yes I am!🇺🇸🇲🇽We live in country with laws that need to be obeyed.I represent the legals that got here the legal way.Hard working,tax paying &amp; law obeying American citizens.I represent the people that want to give back to our country the right way!
@larryfishermac That’s lies! Bs media. Have you been to these facilities? These are the same ones that the Obama administration built.
@larryfishermac Then they shouldn’t break the law by trying to come over illegally. You know that so much more comes over the border. Not just Mexican. This is about keeping our country safe. We need to keep lawfulness in this country.
@larryfishermac If a dad or mom was drunk driving with their kid in the car they would be separated. Because they broke the law. They would go to jail. Once again don’t put your child in a bad situation. Breaking the law it that situation.
@larryfishermac I will prove it’s all lies. This is my goal of the year. I will let you know.

Conor McGregor takes it way too far according to @titoortiz 👀😤  Ortiz shares his thoughts on @TheNotoriousMMA and more on an all new FAIR GAME w/ @KristineLeahy today at 5:30pm ET/2:30pm PT on @FS1 🥊
UFC Hall of Famer @titoortiz is on an all new FAIR GAME with @KristineLeahy, next on @FS1 🥊
😤👀😳 @titoortiz tells @KristineLeahy his side of the story in his beef with @danawhite:
Honestly and transparency is how he all should live our lives!
"I don't hate @danawhite. I love Dana."  @titoortiz tells @KristineLeahy he's willing to be friends with White again despite their falling out:
That is “We”!
